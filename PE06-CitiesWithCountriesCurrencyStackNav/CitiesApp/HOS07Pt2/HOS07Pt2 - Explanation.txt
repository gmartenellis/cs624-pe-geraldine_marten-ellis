Just like the first iteration of our app, we have a main "Cities" screen in which we visualize each city and country we add. Once we add the city and navigate back to the City screen, we can tap on a city (e.g., Tokyo). We are taken to the City screen, which shows any saved locations within that city. If no locations have been added, a message appears saying "No locations for this city." Below, two input fields allow users to add a location name (e.g., "Shibuya District") and an associated description or area (e.g., "Tokyo Prefecture"). Once the user taps "Add Location," the new location is saved under that city and displayed on the screen. Users can navigate back to the Cities screen, which continues to show the list of added citiesâ€”each of which can be tapped to view or update its locations.
