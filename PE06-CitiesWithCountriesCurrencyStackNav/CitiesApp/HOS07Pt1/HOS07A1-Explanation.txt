The first screenshort shows an empty City List screen with a centered message: "No saved cities!" If we click AddCities tab at the bottom of the screen, the app displays a new screen titled “Cities,” with two input text boxes and an “Add City” button below them. After entering the names of the desired city and country on each input textbox and clicking the Add City button, returning to the Cities tab shows us the newly added city: “Tokyo” in bold black text and “Japan” beneath it in smaller gray font. 
The App.js file serves as the root of the application and defines a state variable to store an array of cities and provides a method called addCity that updates this array. Two main tabs are set up in the navigator: one for viewing saved cities (Cities) and another for adding new ones (AddCity). The AddCity component collects input for a city and country, and upon submission, creates an object containing those values along with a unique ID. This object is passed back to the App.js state using the addCity function.
The Cities component displays the list of saved cities using a ScrollView, and if no cities exist, it displays the message “No saved cities!” using the reusable CenterMessage component. The overall look and feel of the app, including color schemes, are maintained through a separate theme.js file.
