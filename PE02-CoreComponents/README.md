# Input
The app begins with a a prompt for the user to input their favorite course using a TextInput field. This gives the opportunity to interact with the app. The input is stored in a state variable called "course" using React's useState hook.

# Process
After receiving the input, the app updates its internal state via the onChangeText handler. While the current version of the app does not display the text entered or perform any processing, it provides a foundation for future extensions, like conditional rendering or data submission. 

# Output
The app visually represents a categorized list of the MSCS program components using organized View containers. Each section is highlighted with distinct styling for clarity and readability.
