# **Input**
The following program displays the user's name, their degree program in progress, and the school, using predefined statis information within the code. 

# **Process**
For this project, structuring and visual components used in React Native were implemented, such as JSX elements and the StyleSheet object. When running, the data is organized into a visually appealing layout, based on established requirements and ensuring visual consistency. 

# **Output**
Upon running the app, we can see a clean display: a name, the academic program's initials, and the name of the school on a yellow background.
